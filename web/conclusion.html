      <p>The work on the site continues, and I am now working on mini-projects to recreate the dynamic content that exists in our current site, such as pulling library hours from a Google calendar and creating a custom textbook lookup module. The addition of an Information Technology Librarian this past spring has been a boon for the new environmentâ€™s server setup and maintenance, and he is interested in learning how to create a complex site in Drupal as well.</p>
      <p>I do not have the luxury of working on this site full-time, so it is important to have a roadmap to use to track its progress. The IT Librarian and I have been using Google Docs to work both collaboratively and asynchronously. With two librarians and several student workers, I hope to have the site ready to launch in beta mode in the fall of 2015.</p>
