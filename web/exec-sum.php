      <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
      
      <p>The current website for the Paul V. Galvin library (library.iit.edu) was designed and developed prior to my arrival at IIT in 2008. 
        I became responsible for the site in 2010 when I accepted the position of Digital Services Librarian. My first changes were organizational: 
        I created code libraries for re-use, documented best practices, and made small improvements to the site--mostly automating more mundane tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The progress I’ve made in building an entirely new library website is what I am presenting as my master’s degree project. The site uses the 
        Drupal, an open-source content management system, and a version of it as of <span class="fix">date here</span> will be included with my supporting documents. To assist the 
        reviewers, the references I’ll use throughout this paper will be available on the current development site at <a href="http://216.47.136.104/" target="_blank">http://216.47.136.104/</a>. Building a 
        new library site has been on my list of projects for some time, and I have made significant progress towards that over the past year. My goal is to 
        create a vastly different site than the one we have now using three key concepts: implementing a content strategy, highlighting the library’s 
        electronic resources, and using a user-centered approach to design.
