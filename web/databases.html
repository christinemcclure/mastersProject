        <h2>Remove the catalog search from the home page</h2>
        <p>The home page of the current library website (<a href="http://library.iit.edu" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu</a>) includes a search box that sends a query to the local instance of the library's online public access catalog (OPAC). There only three types of items an OPAC search will return. The first type includes physical items in the library's collection: books, videos, theses, etc. The second are scanned files from the HathiTrust digital project. This includes digitized content from the Google Books and Internet Archives projects, as well as individual libraries' digitization efforts ("Our Partnership"). The last type of items are bibliographic records for electronic books from vendors. Books24x7 and SpringerLink are two vendors that supply us with these records, but they are in the minority; the library does not receive (nor could our infrastructure accommodate) files of the millions of journal articles that comprise the majority of our database subscriptions. This means that only searching the OPAC for material will leave the majority of the library's collection unused.</p>
        <p>Students will often ignore all other options on the library's cluttered home page in favor of entering their research topic directly into the home page search box,<sup><a id="refsup2" href="#sup2">2</a></sup> which triggers an OPAC search. Some searches yield fruitful results: a search for "javascript" will turn up many relevant examples from our e-book subscriptions (see result at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/OMQSRUT" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/OMQSRUT</a>). If the search doesn't locate items owned by the Galvin Library, however, the results page will either show results from the HathiTrust database, or display a "no results found" message. An example would be a search about the "fall of the Roman Empire". Searching for this phrase will return many results from the OPAC (seen here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/Q5VT9MX" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/Q5VT9MX</a>), but it is unlikely that an undergraduate student writing a short paper for a history class will be interested in the five-volume set written in 1845&mdash;this was the first item returned when this paper was written.</p>

        <p><sup><a id="sup2" href="#refsup2">2</a></sup>This and the following are examples of IIT students' behavior, either provided anecdotally by the students themselves, or witnessed by librarians watching students do research.</p>
        
        <p>Students who only search for their topic from the library home page become frustrated by the limited results and often abandon the library site for Google. A cognitive bias now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect leads them to believe that the thousands of results they get from a search in Google or another search engine means that they are performing research effectively (Gross 2012). Justin Kruger and David Dunning's 1999 study of psychology students showed that those who lack knowledge in an area cannot successfully judge competence in that areaâ€”either their own or in others (Kruger 1999). </p>
        <p>Software has been developed to simulate the Google experience for library users; it is called a "discovery layer" and allows an institution access to a centralized index of millions of journal articles, along with the local holdings of the library (Hoeppner 2012). Galvin Library does not have a subscription to discovery later software such as Primo, Summon, or AquaBrowser, so it is imperative we improve the display of our electronic resources. The library budget from 2013 allocated 88% of its purchasing funds on subscription resources like databases versus 3% of one-time purchase of books, videos, and similar items. This suggests that the website should focus more on database subscriptions rather than books, but that is not currently the case. Figure 7 below is a screenshot of the library's home page, with book resource links highlighted</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/home-page-books.png" />          
        <p>Next is the same page with the library's electronic resources highlighted (those that can be accessed from off-campus). </p>
        <p class="caption" id="f8">Figure 8: Current home page, database items.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/home-page-databases.png" />          
        
        <p>All of these items require an additional clicks to get to the information, something many students aren't willing to attempt. One major change to the new site will be to remove the OPAC search box from the library home page and replace it links that will more quickly direct students to databases. The new home page change will reflect the preference for electronic items over print. This will also bring the site into alignment with the library's vision of providing "innovative programs, infrastructure and outreach" ("Paul V. Galvin - Mission"). A recent study has shown that use of the library's databases or e-books are one predictor of success in first year undergraduates: students who used the library and its resources had a higher average GPA than those who did not (Soria, 2013).</p>
  

        <h2>Add a database quick search on the new home page</h2>
        <p>There is a method to allow students to perform a search of severalâ€”not allâ€”subscription databases that could be placed on the home page of the new site without additional cost. Interfaces by the companies EBSCO and ProQuest have the ability to search several of their own database holdings. For the student quickly looking for articles to support a short research paper, a search form such as this may provide enough immediate results to encourage them to stay on the library's website instead of abandoning it for Google. <span class="fix">Create this and add link</span></p>
