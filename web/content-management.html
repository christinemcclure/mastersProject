      <h2>Content Inventory</h2>
      <p>The first step in developing the new site was to create an inventory of pages on the current site. This was done by one of the reference department's student workers. At my direction, she created a spreadsheet with each page's title, URL, and a brief summary of the content. I then looked up Google analytics statistics for each page for the Fall 2013-Spring 2014 school year. Google Analytics segments user sessions using a computer's IP address and a default time of 30 minutes ("How a Session"). Since the library's computers can be used by several students within that timeframe, I used pageview counts rather than the session information to analyze the content. Each page's percentage of the total number of pageviews was listed on the inventory as a percentage. The content inventory is included as Appendix A, but below is a subset of information from the inventory in order of the top-performing pages (see table 1).

    </p>
    
    <p>The analytics were less useful than I anticipated they would be. I thought I would be able to use the spreadsheet to discover out-of-date information that should be removed from the current site and not ported to the new one (Pressley 2011), but the vast number of pages on the site either had no data<sup><a href="#sup1" id="refsup1">1</a></sup> or had a less than one percent view rate. 
    </p>

    <p><sup><a id="sup1" href="#refsup1">1</a></sup>Some pages redirected to another domain not included in Galvin Library's statistics, but most pages without data were due to an unknown error.</p>    
        
      <p>
    I had planned on using the statistics to weed the website of unpopular pages by determining a pageview threshold: pages below a cutoff point would not be included in the new site. The statistics showed that another approach would have to be taken. Only a few pages on the site had significant usage, and using a threshold would suggest that most pages on the site should be dropped. But a lack of pageviews did not indicate old or unnecessary information, as others have found (Betz 2014). The fines and fees page, for example, had an access rate of only 0.09%, but this is still critical content that will need to be included in the new site as it tells students&mdash;who cannot graduate if they have any outstanding fines&mdash;how to determine the amount due and where to pay their fines. Pages outlining other library policies and services have a similarly low percentage of pageviews, but they must remain on the site so that staff have publicly-available text to refer to when enforcing an unpopular policy. 
  </p>

    One area where the analytics were helpful was in viewing pageviews for the satellite libraries under my purview. Currently, the Graham Resource Center (located in Crown Hall on the main campus) and the Institute of Food Safety & Health Library (located at the Moffett campus) have their own sites; they exist as subfolders under the main website structure (<a href="http://library.iit.edu/grc" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/grc</a>). They each have their own content, but the vast majority of the pages are pulling content in from the main site using PHP "include" functions. Each library has a separate code for analytics tracking, and the statistics have shown that only minimal information simply including a page that lists each library's hours and location will be sufficient for the new site. In the image below, there are only two pieces of content that are not duplicated on the Galvin site. One is the library hours page at number two, and the other is number nine (<a href="http://library.iit.edu/grc/mies" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/grc/mies/</a>), which uncovered a directory of web pages that are not accessible from the GRC website but still exist on the server. They were likely accessed by someone who was doing research on the architect Mies van der Rohe. This content will be reviewed to determine if it contains any unique material, or if the IIT University Archives pages about IIT's most famous architect are sufficiently robust.

      <h2>Content Structure</h2>  
      <p>The greatest improvement to the site will be having a plan in how the content is presented to users. The most pertinent information is not always highlighted, for example, on the faculty page (see figure 3), there is a link to information for new IIT faculty, but it is the very last item listed and will scroll off the page on smaller computer monitors. </p>

      <p class="caption">Available online at <a href="http://library.iit.edu/faculty/" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/faculty/</a></p>
      <img src="/assets/images/faculty.png" />
      
    <p>Our current site was hand-coded using PHP and a MySQL database; there is no content management system to help control the flow of information. The new Drupal site will allow us to plan for related content rules that will automatically display along with certain subjects. The most noticeable example will be including the types of content our subscription databases contain. Right now, one can find a list of databases by format on the current site and then access a list of databases like the thesis example in figure 4:</p>
    
      <p class="caption" id="f4">Figure 4: Screenshot of the resources available for dissertations and theses.</p>
      <p class="caption">Available online at <a href="http://library.iit.edu/formats" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/formats</a>.</p>
      <img src="/assets/images/dissertations.png" />    
      
      <p>This format link is difficult to find on the website, and exists independently of the main databases page (<a href="http://library.iit.edu/databases/" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/databases/</a>). The new site includes a one-to many field reference for format type within the database record (see figure 5):</p>
        
      <p class="caption" id="f5">Figure 5: Screenshot of a sample database page, providing links to other resources using the same subjects and formats.</p>
      <p class="caption">Available online at <a href="http://216.47.136.104/databases/538" target="_blank">http://216.47.136.104/databases/538</a></p>
      <img src="/assets/images/psycinfo.png" />    
      
      <p>Users will be able to click on the format type listed to access more resources. </p>
      
      <h3>Microinteractions</h3>
      <p>There is a new phrase being used user design: microinteractions. They are, as described by Saffer "a tiny piece of functionality that does only one thing" (2013). Inviting a user to "like" a Facebook page or sign up for an email list (King 2014) are two examples. Most microinteractions seem to be designed for marketing purposes, but I think the idea can be leveraged for patron questions as well. One example would be on the pages that deal with user policies; the text could end with a form: "Have more questions about our 24-hour access policy? Ask us here." The form submission would then send an email to the appropriate department. I expect that fewer questions would be left unanswered in users' minds if we offer a "point of sale" contact method rather than making them locate our contact information themselves.</p>
      
      <h3>Increase Readability</h3>
      <p>The current site is very text heavy and written in paragraph style rather than an outline. Many of the current site's pages average a fourteenth grade reading level, using a simple online tool at readability-score.com (see figure 6). This should be lowered substantially to remove barriers to students accessing our resources (Costello 2014) and will be particularly helpful for our non-native English speaking students.</p>
      
      <p class="caption" id="f6">Figure 6: Assessment of the Access & Usage text from readability-score.com.</p>
      <p class="caption">Text from <a href="http://library.iit.edu/policies/access.php" target="_blank">http://library.iit.edu/policies/access.php</a></p>
      <img src="/assets/images/readability.png" />  
      
      <p>The example above displays only about one-third of the text on the site and is a very dense read. The reference department has a library student doing practicum work for us this semester, and she is currently making a first attempt at re-writing much of this content.</p>
      
      <p>The switch to a content management system will also allow us to create staff logins with different levels of access to the system. The internal stakeholders can then implement a workflow that will require a review process for certain types of information, similar to what was implemented at one New York University health Sciences Libraries (Morten-Owens 2011).</p>
